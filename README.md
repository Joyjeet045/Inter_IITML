1. The **GIF_Scratch** approach leverages a **pipeline** implementing pretrained vision encoder & text encoder and finally **custom frame selectors & LSTMs** to capture temporal features of the captured video & question-answer encodings.
   
2. The **GIF_FineTune** approach uses the **Qwen Vision Language Model**, which performs end-to-end video QA tasks and is fine-tuned using **LoRA**.
